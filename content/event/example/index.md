abstract: In this talk, I will present my research paper on noisy few-shot learning (NFSL). As a typical learning to learning with noisy label method, data cleansing failed in few-shot learning (FSL) due to the scarcity of training data. It exacerbates information loss in FSL due to limited training data, resulting in inadequate model training. To best recover the underlying task manifold corrupted by the noisy labels, we resort to learning from uniquely designed unsupervised auxiliary tasks to compensate for information loss. Using unsupervised tasks can effectively avoid additional annotation costs and minimize the risk of introducing additional label noises. However, a randomly constructed unsupervised task may misguide the model to learn sample-specific features that are likely to compromise the primary few-shot learning task due to the noisy weak learning signals. We propose to conduct novel auxiliary task selection to ensure the intra-diversity among the unlabeled samples within a task. Domain invariant features are then learned from carefully constructed auxiliary tasks to best recover the original data manifold.
